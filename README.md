# riko project

This project is build using Kotlin and Quarkus Framework.

The main idea is to have an easy way to calculate the stocks pie weights based on some pre-defined strategies.

For feature requests, questions and bugs, please open an issue.

The current implementation is experimental, don't expect all sort of validations and a long list of calculation strategies.
 
You can try the project running on heroku:

A more detailed README is coming soon.
